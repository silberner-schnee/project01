                Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was the scientist credited for creating the AC (alternating current)
                electric system commonly used in today's world, and for designing Tesla coils (electrical resonant transformer circuits), which are still in use today in radio technology.
            <br>
                Although Tesla designed and developed many other important technologies, they have been attributed 
                to other inventors (George Westinghouse owned the patent rights for AC technology).
            </p>
            <p>
            <br>
                Tesla greatly contributed to the discovery of the rotating magnetic field, radar technology, electric generators, the induction motor, and x-ray technology. 
            <br>
                Sadly, despite his many accomplishments Tesla was never a rich man, and due to his lack of financial prowess many of his ideas have been relegated to notebooks where they remain.
