            <p>
                Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was the scientist credited for creating the AC (alternating current)
                electric system commonly used in today's world, and for designing Tesla coils (electrical resonant transformer circuits), which are still in use today in radio technology.
            <br>
                Although Tesla designed and developed many other important technologies, they have been attributed 
                to other inventors (George Westinghouse owned the patent rights for AC technology).
            </p>
            <p>
            <br>
                Tesla greatly contributed to the discovery of the rotating magnetic field, radar technology, electric generators, the induction motor, and x-ray technology. 
            <br>
                Sadly, despite his many accomplishments Tesla was never a rich man, and due to his lack of financial prowess many of his ideas have been relegated to notebooks where they remain.

                            <p>Tesla enrolled into a Polytechnic academic institution under a military scholarship. He achieved the highest grades possible and managed to found a culture club.
                                <br>
                                In his second year at the college, he was already arguing with his professors, this time over the functionality of the Gramme dynamo.

                            <p>With financial help from his uncle, Tesla relocated to Prague to complete his studies. <br>
                            Because he did not speak Czech or Greek, he failed to qualify for the courses he wished to pursue, finally deciding to study Philosophy. <br>
                        Tesla did not receive a grade for any of these courses.</p>

                            <p>Moving to Budapest, Hungary, Tesla intitally tried to apply to work for a telegraph company
                                called "Budapest Telegraph Exchange" (BTS). <br>
                                The company was not currently in operation, so he took up a draftsman position in another company. <br>
                                Within a few months, BTS had resumed business, and Tesla successfully applied for a position there as 
                                a Chief Electrical Engineer. <br>
                                Tesla was responsible for improving the company's performance during his tenture there.

                                At this company Tesla improved his engineering knowledge <br>
                                The local management noticed his ability and added him to the team responsible for producing
                                dynamos and motors. <br>
