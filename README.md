# Tesla Project

The Tesla project is a website that endeavors to educate teenagers to adults on the significance of Nikola Tesla's life, and how he has contributed to modern society. The overall aim is to provide a light overview of this topic and to instill a curiosity to learn more. 

Users of the website can find information about Nikola Tesla's life and accomplishments through a short biography, a timeline of notable events, and through watching videos about Tesla and his contributions to science.
